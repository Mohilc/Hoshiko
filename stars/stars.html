              <h2 class='title'>"White Dwarf"</h2>
              <p class='description'> Definition: A white dwarf is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. It is the final evolutionary state of stars not massive enough to become neutron stars or black holes1.
                Density: White dwarfs are incredibly dense. Their mass is comparable to the Sun’s, but their volume is similar to Earth’s1.
                Luminosity: They have low luminosity, emitting residual thermal energy since no fusion occurs within them1.
                Temperature: White dwarfs have surface temperatures ranging from 8,000 to 40,000 K2.
                Lifespan: They can exist for billions of years, gradually cooling over time2.
                Examples: Notable white dwarfs include Sirius B and Procyon B2.
                Formation: They form when stars with initial masses up to about 8 times that of the Sun exhaust their nuclear fuel and shed their outer layers3.
                Support Mechanism: White dwarfs are supported against gravitational collapse by electron degeneracy pressure1  </p>

              <h2 class='title'>"Red Dwarf"</h2>
              <p class='description'> Definition: Red dwarf stars are the smallest and coolest stars on the main sequence, typically of spectral class M or K1.
                Prevalence: They are the most common type of star in the Milky Way galaxy, making up about 73% of all stars1.
                Temperature: Red dwarfs have surface temperatures ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 K2.
                Luminosity: They are much dimmer than the Sun, with luminosities ranging from 0.0001 to 0.8 times that of the Sun1.
                Lifespan: Red dwarfs have incredibly long lifespans, potentially lasting trillions of years due to their slow hydrogen fusion process2.
                Mass: They typically have masses between 0.08 and 0.6 times that of the Sun3.
                Examples: Notable red dwarfs include Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Sun, and TRAPPIST-12.
                Formation: They form from clouds of dust and gas pulled together by gravity, similar to other main-sequence stars2.
                Fusion Process: Red dwarfs burn hydrogen both in their cores and throughout their entire structure, which contributes to their extended lifetimes</p>

              <h2 class='title'>"Neutron Star"</h2>
              <p class='description'> Definition: Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of massive supergiant stars, formed after a supernova explosion1.
                Density: They are incredibly dense; a sugar-cube-sized amount of neutron star material would weigh about a billion tons on Earth1.
                Size: Typically, neutron stars have a radius of about 10 kilometers (6 miles)1.
                Mass: They usually have a mass between 1.4 and 2.1 times that of the Sun1.
                Temperature: Newly formed neutron stars can have surface temperatures of around 1 million K, cooling over time1.
                Rotation: Neutron stars can rotate extremely rapidly, up to several hundred times per second2.
                Magnetic Fields: They possess extremely strong magnetic fields, which can be billions of times stronger than Earth’s2.
                Types: There are different types of neutron stars, including pulsars and magnetars2.
                Examples: Notable neutron stars include the Crab Pulsar and PSR J0952-0607, the most massive neutron star detected so far

              <h2 class='title'>"Brown Dwarf"</h2>
              <p class='description'>
                Definition: Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that are more massive than the largest gas giant planets but less massive than the smallest stars1.
Formation: They form like stars through the gravitational collapse of gas clouds but do not gain enough mass to sustain hydrogen fusion2.
Mass Range: Typically between 13 and 80 times the mass of Jupiter1.
Temperature: Surface temperatures range from about 1,500 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit (830 to 1,500 degrees Celsius)3.
Recent Discovery: The James Webb Space Telescope recently identified the smallest known free-floating brown dwarf, with only three to four times the mass of Jupiter34.
Location: Brown dwarfs can be found in various star-forming regions, such as the IC 348 cluster in the Perseus constellation4.
Observation: They emit most of their light in the infrared spectrum, making them detectable with infrared telescopes1.

              <h2 class='title'>"Protostar"</h2>
              <p class='description'>
                Definition: A protostar is a very young star that is still gathering mass from its parent molecular cloud1.
                Formation: Protostars form when a dense region within a molecular cloud collapses under its own gravity12.
                Duration: For low-mass stars (like the Sun), the protostar phase lasts about 500,000 years1.
                Temperature: Protostars have lower temperatures compared to main-sequence stars3.
                Evolution: The phase ends when the infalling gas is depleted, leaving a pre-main-sequence star1.
                Observation: Protostars are often observed in regions with high concentrations of gas and dust, such as the Orion Nebula2.
                Current Research: NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope is actively studying protostars to understand their

              <p class='description'> Key Points:

                Saturn is the second-largest planet in the Solar System.
                It has the most extensive ring system of any planet.
                Saturn has 82 moons, including Titan, the largest moon in the Solar System.
                The planet is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.
                Saturn's atmosphere is characterized by strong winds and storms.
                The planet has a faint magnetic field.
                Saturn's moons offer potential for habitability.
                Future missions aim to explore Saturn's moons and rings.  </p>
