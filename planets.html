              <h2 class='title'>"Mercury"</h2>
              <p class='description'> Mercury's Position & Size: First planet from the Sun and smallest in the Solar System. Diameter: 4,880 km.

                Naming: Named after the Roman god Mercurius, associated with commerce, communication, and messengers.
                
                Classification: Terrestrial planet, with surface gravity similar to Mars.
                
                Surface Features: Heavily cratered due to billions of impact events. Largest crater: Caloris Planitia (1,550 km in diameter).
                
                Similarities to the Moon: Contains expansive rupes (cliffs) and bright ray systems from impacts.
                
                Day/Year Length: Spin-orbit resonance of 3:2. Sidereal day: 58.65 Earth days. Sidereal year: 88 Earth days. One solar day lasts 176 Earth days.
                
                Extreme Temperatures: Ranges from −170 °C at night to 420 °C during daylight. Poles may contain water ice due to permanent shadowing.
                
                Atmosphere: Tenuous exosphere and faint magnetic field that can deflect solar wind.
                
                Geological History: Still under investigation, likely includes a solid silicate crust, a magma ocean early in its history, and a layered core (outer solid, liquid layer, and solid inner core).
                
                Origins: Competing hypotheses suggest impacts with planetesimals and rock vaporization contributed to Mercury’s formation.  </p>

              <p class='description'> Closest to Earth: Venus is Earth's "sister planet" in size, mass, and composition.
                Hottest planet: Surface temperature averages 465°C (900°F) due to a runaway greenhouse effect.
                Slow retrograde rotation: Spins opposite to most planets; one Venus day is longer than a year.
                Thick, toxic atmosphere: Composed of 96.5% CO2, with clouds of sulfuric acid.
                Volcanic landscape: Tens of thousands of volcanoes; surface regularly reshaped by lava.
                No moons/rings: Unique among inner planets like Mercury.
                Brightest planet: Reflects 70% of sunlight; often mistaken for UFOs.
                Potential past habitability: May have had oceans and microbial life.
                Future exploration: Missions include concepts like floating cities in the upper atmosphere.  </p>

              <h2 class='title'>"Earth"</h2>
              <p class='description'> Earth's Name Origin: Derived from Anglo-Saxon "erda" and Germanic "erde," meaning soil/ground.

                Formation: Formed 4.5 billion years ago from a solar nebula. Oceans, atmosphere, and continents formed through volcanic activity and plate tectonics.
                
                Size and Distance: Earth's diameter is 12,742 km, 5th largest planet, situated in the "Goldilocks zone" for life.
                
                Structure: Four layers – inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. Core temperature hotter than the Sun’s surface.
                
                Surface: 71% water, 29% land. Continents move due to tectonic plates. Highest point: Mount Everest; lowest: Dead Sea.
                
                Atmosphere: Five layers, with 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen. Ozone layer protects from UV radiation.
                
                Magnetosphere: Shields Earth from solar winds, creating auroras.
                
                Hydrosphere: Only known planet with liquid water, critical for life.
                
                Habitability: Biosphere developed 3.5 billion years ago. Life possibly originated from chemical reactions or panspermia.
                
                Unexplored Areas: 80% of oceans and 65% of Earth remain unmapped.
                
                Moon: Formed from a collision with Earth. Tidal locking ensures we see only one side.  </p>

                Size:

              Radius: 3,389 km (2,105 mi)
                Diameter: 6,779 km (4,212 mi)
                Mass: 6.42 x 10²³ kg (about 10 times less than Earth).

                Gravity: 38% of Earth's gravity.

                Rotation: Day length of 24.6 hours; year lasts 669.6 days.

                Historical Observations:

                Documented for over 4,000 years; first observed through a telescope by Galileo in 1610.
                Named after the Roman god of war due to its red appearance.
                Geological Features:

                Olympus Mons: Tallest volcano in the Solar System (13 miles/21 km).
                Valles Marineris: Largest canyon (4,000 km long).
                Evidence of ancient river valleys and deltas, indicating past water presence.
                Climate:

                Average temperature: -80°F (-60°C), with extreme lows near -195°F (-125°C) at the poles.
                Longer seasons due to elliptical orbit; dust storms can cover the planet for months.
                Moons:

                Two small moons: Phobos (25 km) and Deimos (15 km).
                Phobos is gradually spiraling inward towards Mars.

                Jupiter's Rings
Formation: Composed of dust particles ejected from inner moons like Adrastea and Metis.
Structure: Three main components: halo ring, main ring, and gossamer rings.
Composition: Primarily dust particles, unlike Saturn's icy rings.
Faintness: Much fainter and less reflective than Saturn's rings.
Discovery: First discovered by Voyager 1 in 1979.
Dynamics: Constantly changing due to collisions, gravitational interactions, and magnetic field influence.
Observation: Can be observed from Earth with large telescopes under favorable conditions.

                It was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel.
                Uranus is an ice giant, primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane.
                It has a distinctive blue-green color due to methane gas.
                Uranus has a unique axial tilt, causing it to rotate on its side.
                The planet has 13 rings and 27 moons.
                Uranus has a cold and windy atmosphere.

                It was discovered in 1846 through mathematical predictions.
                Neptune is primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
                It has a blue color due to methane gas.
                Neptune has the strongest winds of any planet in the Solar System.

                Neptune has a faint ring system.
                It was visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989.
                Neptune's moon Triton is a captured dwarf planet and may have a subsurface ocean.
